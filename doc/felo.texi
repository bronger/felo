@top The Felo program for estimating sport fencers objectively

Felo calculates Felo ratings for fencers.  Felo ratings give a good
impression about a fencer's fencing strength.  The program is intended
for fencing groups for having an additional incentive, or even for
having a criterium for team selections and seedings.

Quite reliable ratings for a couple of fencer is already possible after
a few intensive training days.  There is no real upper limit.  The only
thing necessary is the the results of as many bouts as possibly must be
collected and typed into the computer; the calculation itself is very
quick.

The program can be used conveniently through a graphical user interface.
Additionally, for the enthusiasts among you, it is possible to use just
the core of this program in order to build own applications around it,
e.@s{}g.@: for updating a club webpage automatically.

The Felo program is Free Software.  In particular, this means that it
can be distributed freely, and everybody is allowed to download and to
change the source code.  Its author, however, would be very happy if you
-- in case you use the program -- would send him a postcard
(T.@tie{}Bronger, Lochnerstraße@tie{}7, 52064@tie{}Aachen, Germany;
please include the RWTH fencers in your greetings, we are glad to hear
from fellow fencing groups).  Additionally, you can help by

@node Felo ratings
@chapter What are Felo ratings?

Felo ratings are a wonderful new method to estimate the strength of
sport fencers, without this annoying luck component which is typical of
elimination tournaments and single bouts. The new Felo rating is
calculated after every bout.  Thus, it is always present and
up-to-date.  As a result, the fencer has a quite clear impression about
how good he or she is currently.  Whithin a group, the Felo ratings are
very accurate, however, they can even be compared globally.

The underlying idea is all but new.  It is inspired by the Elo ratings
in chess.  There, they have been used for 35@tie{}years for determining
the official word ranking list, which works terrificly.  Not only that
it yields a plausible ranking, it also allows for precise calculations
of chances in upcoming chess matches.

Over the yeras, the Elo ratings have been adapted sucessfully to other
sports such as Go, college football, and international soccer.  With the
Felo program, they can now be used in fencing, too.  ``Felo'' is nothing
else but ``fencing Elo''.  In contrast to other Elo sports, Felo ratings
take also the exact bout result into account.  Therefore, a 15:14 win is
rated lower than a 15:0.  This sounds obvious but in chess, there's only
win, loss, and draw.

In typical leisure fencing groups, the Felo ratings will be between 1300
and 1800.  Here is a rough overview of how Felo ratings should be
interpreted:

@table @asis
@item above 2500
fencing like a young god

@item above 2400
international masters

@item above 2200
national masters

@item above 1800
very good club fencers

@item above 1600
strong leisure fencers

@item above 1400
weak and average leisure fencers

@item above 1300
beginners

@item 1200
lower limit
@end table

The tables shouldn't be taken too seriously because there isn't yet much
experience with Felo ratings so far.

By and large, Felo is -- sigh -- the product of a lone fighter so far.
(Please no pity, it was fun.)  However, I did have some help from
others.

@table @asis
@item Marc Ensenbach
being a skilled mathematician, has verified my concept as far as this
was at all possible, and has pointed out errors (which I corrected).

@item Stefan Mainka
has archived the bout results in my university fencing group long before
the Felo program came into existance.  For me, this was a great luck of
course because I could test the concept rather quickly.  I also thank
the RWTH fencing group in general for allowing me to publish out Felo
ratings on the (internal) web pages, which was pretty encouraging.

@node Installation on Windows
@section Installation on Windows

First, download the program from
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=183431,
Felo's project page on Sourceforge} as an EXE file, and start it.
There are two alternatives: You can start is as an ordinary user or as
an administrator.  In the latter case, it is installed for all users on
this computer.

Installation itself is very simple.  It should be sufficient to click on
``Ok'' a couple of times.  The uninstallation is euqallay simple but
assure that you are logged in on the same account you used for the
installation because otherwise, Felo may not be completely removed.

If you are not interested in graphical plots of the Felo ratings, you
can proceed with @ref{Using Felo}.

@end menu


@node Gnuplot
@subsection Gnuplot

First you have to download
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2055&package_id=1996,Gnuplot
as a ZIP file}.  The file name is @file{gp400win32.zip} or something
similar, where @file{400} is the version number.  Extract this ZIP file
into the folder @file{C:\Programme\gnuplot}.


@node Ghostscript
@subsection Ghostscript

Ghostscript can be downloaded from the
@uref{ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/GPL/gs854/,FTP mirror
for Ghostscript} (you need the EXE file).  It is important to be
administrator when executing this file!


@node ImageMagick
@subsection ImageMagick

On the @uref{http://www.imagemagick.org,homepage of ImageMagick} you
click on ``Binary Releases'' -- ``Windows'', download one of the EXE
files and start is (as administrator if possible).


@node Installation on Linux
@section Installation on Linux

The program is avaiable at
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=183431,
Felo's project page} in two variants for Linux, namely as an RPM and as
a tar ball.  The RPM contains Python as its only dependency, however, it
also needs @uref{http://www.wxpython.org/,wxPython}, at least for the
GUI part.  Since this has become a standard package, it shouldn't be a
problem.

If you are interested in having plots, you need the very same three
programs as the Windows users, namely
@uref{http://www.gnuplot.info,Gnuplot},
@uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/,Ghostscript}, and
@uref{http://www.imagemagick.org,ImageMagick}.  They are standard
packages, too, so it shouldn't be a problem either.


@node Using Felo
@chapter Using Felo

Star the Felo program.  This opens the program window with an empty
editor area.  There you can entrer the Felo file.  The Felo file
contains all fencers and gouts of a fencing group for which Felo
ratings should be calculated.  Over time, the felo file will grow
further and further since new bouts are constantly appended to it.

At the moement you probably don't know yet how a Felo file looks like.
No problem.  Just click an the menu ``File'' -- ``New''.  This loads a
sample Felo file into the editor:

@image{felo-screen-1-de,10cm,,Sample Felo file}

A Felo file consists of three parts:

@enumerate
@item
parameters

@item
fencer list

@item
bout list

@end enumerate

@noindent
These three parts are separated by lines made of equal signs (their
length is irrelevant).  Let's have a look at what the parts contain:

@table @strong
@item parameters
Parameters can be the name of the group (e.@s{}g.@: for the distinction
between the three weapons, and/or between men and women), or settings
which change the appearance of the plots, or settings modifying the
calculation of the Felo ratings.

Every parameter is in a row of its own, with two columns.  In the first
column, the name of the parameter (e.@s{}g.@: ``groupname''), and in the
second column, the value of this parameter (e.@s{}g.@: ``foil'') is
given.

You may well leave the parameter part empty.  In this case, Felo assumes
default values which will be sensible mostly.  For more info, @xref{List
of all parameters}.

@item fencer list
Here, you have to list all fencers of the group, one per row.  This
part, too, has two columns, for the fencer's name and his or her
@emph{initial} Felo rating.  AT the beginning, nobody has Felo number
yet, but I'll explain below how to get them, @xref{Getting initial Felo
ratings}.

An important feature is that all fencers whose name are put in
parentheses @samp{(...)} won't get a Felo number.  This is for fencers
who are afraid of knowing their fencing strength, or who are concerned
about their privacy.  Nevertheless, their bouts should be included
anyway because it helps with calculation the other's Felo ratings,
unless of course they object to it.

@item bout list
Here you list all bouts and their results, one per row.  Empty lines
inbetween are allowed, as is also the case for the rest of a Felo file.
Every line consists of three columns, namely the date of the bout, the
opponents, and the result.  The date @emph{must} be given in the form
@samp{YYYY-MM-DD}, i.@s{}e.@: year, month, day, separated by dashes.

The opponents must be given in the form @emph{first -- second},
i.@s{}e.@: both fencers are separated by two dashes.

@end table


@cartouche
@strong{Important: In Felo files, columns are separated by tab stops
@key{Tab}.  It doesn't matter how many, but it must be at least one.}
@end cartouche

You may add comments at arbitrary places in a Felo file.  For example,
you may mark bouts, for which you'd like to double-check the result, or
you may mark places where a couple of bouts are still missing.  Lines
with commens start with a @samp{#} sign.  Felo ignores such lines
completely.

@end menu


@node Additional data for bouts
@section Additional data for bouts

Most of the time you will enter bouts.  There are a couple of further
things you should know concerning entering bouts.  In principle, the
format of a bout is very straightforward:

@example
2006-12-24      Jesus -- Gabriel        15:3
@end example

@noindent
The three columns are separated by tab stops @key{Tab}.

If you have a sequence of bouts of the same day, only the forst one
needs to have a date.  This makes is possible to make the bout list
somewhat clearer:

@example
2006-05-01      Anakin -- Elmer         5:3
                Anakin -- Wile Coyote   5:1
                Elmer -- Wile Coyote    5:3
                Elmer -- Anakin         1:5
                Wile Coyote -- Anakin   2:5
                Elmer -- Wile Coyote    5:10
                Anakin -- Wile Coyote   9:10
@end example

@unnumberedsubsec Day index

If you know the chronological order of the bouts of one day, you can be
very fussy and add a so-called day index to the date, counting
from@tie{}1:

@example
2006-12-07.1    Peter -- Mike           15:12
           2    Peter -- Julia          13:15
           3    Julia -- Mike           8:15
           4    Mike -- Max             10:15
@end example

@noindent
(Bouts without an index get the index@tie{}`@math{0}' internally.)

@c @unnumberedsubsec Gefechte, die über die Zeit entschieden werden

@c Das folgende Gefecht

@c @example
@c                 Schröder -- Kohl        4:5 /15
@c @end example

@c ist über die Zeit beendet worden.  Damit Felo weiß, auf wieviele Punkte
@c gefochten wurde, wird noch ein @samp{/15}
@c angehängt.@footnote{Fairerweise muß ich zugeben, daß dies ein Relikt aus
@c einer älteren Fassung des Programms ist.  Der aktuelle Algorithmus zur
@c Berechnung der Felo-Zahl nutzt diese Info gar nicht -- aber es kann bei
@c einer Änderung der Spielregeln für die Felo-Zahlen signifikant werden.
@c Beispielsweise kann lokal eine Fechtgruppe alle Gefechte gewichten nach
@c der Siegpunktzahl und nicht nach der Anzahl der gefochtenen Treffer.
@c Dafür muß sie zwar den Quellcode etwas modifizieren, aber dann wird
@c diese Info gebraucht.

@c Unter Freizeitfechtern ist das ohnehin nicht wichtig, weil es dort sehr
@c selten ist, daß ein Gefecht über die Zeit beendet wird.}

@unnumberedsubsec Single bouts in a team match

Every single bout within a tema relay match is a quite ordinary single
bout -- so why not use it for the Felo rating.  Unfortunately, it
happens that a strong player beats a weak player with an extremly high
result, say,@tie{}18:1.  Mathematically, this doesn't effect the
fairness and reliability of Felo ratings, however, beginners could
become reluctant in taking part in a team match at all.  Therefore, you
can mark team bouts with a@tie{}@samp{*}:

@example
2006-10-12.1    Anakin -- Elmer         5:0 *
           2    Wile Coyote -- Anakin   3:10*
           3    Wile Coyote -- Elmer    5:5 *
           4    Anakin -- Elmer         8:0 *
           5    Wile Coyote -- Anakin   3:10*
           6    Wile Coyote -- Elmer    3:5 *
@end example

@noindent
Such bouts are weighted like a 5@tie{}points bout, no matter of the
result.  Weighting them not too highly probably is a good idea anyway
since team matches seem to follow their own rules.

@unnumberedsubsec Foreign fencers and fencing in a foreign group

Foreign fencers are fencers who belong to another club or college (for
example) but they come for a training day nevertheless.  They may also
be fencer you meet on a tournament.  Be that as it may, they have a
current Felo rating, yet they are not listed in the Felo file.  It would
make sense to add them since they fence in another group normally, so
you cannot keep track of their Felo rating.

Despite this, bouts with them should be used in the calculation:

@example
2006-10-14      Anakin -- Riker <1764>      0:5
@end example

@noindent
Thus, you give their Felo rating (hopefully they don't fib about it) in
angle brackets @samp{<...>}.  You can add their name, too; the Felo
program doesn't care.

This works in both direction of course.  If a fencer of your group
reports to have won in another group or on a tournament against a 1452
fencer 15:11, you can add it accordingly.

By the way, it may be appropriate to makr bouts with foreign fencers
with a @samp{*} as well because their Felo rating is not as credible
and/or compatible as a local Felo rating.


@node Calculating Felo ratings
@section Calculating Felo ratings

Calculating the current Felo numbers is almost trivial.  Click on the
menu ``Calculate'' -- ``Calculare Felo ratings''.  A window with the
Felo ratings table for the current group opens.  Freshman are excluded
from this list, @xref{Estimating freshmen}, as are fencers who doesn't
want to have a Felo rating.

@image{felo-screen-4-de,10cm,,Calculated Felo ratings}

By clicking on ``copy to clipboard'', the table is copied to the Windows
clipboard in a form which can easily be inserted into Word or Excel, in
order to make it facnier, or to print or archive it.


@node Putting the Felo ratings on the Web
@section Putting the Felo ratings on the Web

The simplest way to tell all fencers in the group their Felo ratings is
to publish in on a Web page.  How to get webspace and how to manage it
is beyond this manual, however, the Felo program can help you with
generating the Web page itself.

Click on the menu ``Calculate'' -- ``Generate HTML''.  The following
dialog window opens:

@image{felo-screen-5-de,4cm,,Generate HTML dialog}

@noindent
First you should check whether the folder Felo wants to write the Web
page makes sense.  Per default, it is the folder of the Felo file.  You
can set this folder explicitly with the parameter ``output folder''.
For example, you can say in the parameters part of your Felo file

@smallexample
output folder           C:\Documents and Settings\myname\My Files
@end smallexample

@noindent
Then all Web-relevant files are written to your ``My Files'' folder.

But let's go back to the dialog window above.  When you click on
``Okay'', the HTML file with the Felo ratings list is written to the
given folder and -- in case your marked the checkbox -- a preview window
is displayed.

A special feature is the generation of plots on which the fencer can see
the chronological development of his or her Felo rating.
@strong{Attention:} Gnuplot, Ghostscript, and ImageMagick must be
installed so that this works, @xref{Installation of auxilliary
programs}.  On the screenshot below you can see the whole picture,
i.@s{}e.@: with plot.

At the same time, Felo reports in an extra windows which files must be
uploaded to the Web server.

By the way, the HTML file includes a CSS stylesheet called
@file{felo.css}.  If it exists, it influences the whole layout of the
Web page.  I cannot discuss it in further detail here, people capable of
CSS will know what to do anyway.

@image{felo-screen-6-de,8cm,,HTML preview with plot}


@node Getting initial Felo ratings
@section Getting initial Felo ratings

There are two quite different situations where it is necessary to
estimate an initial Felo rating: First, when the whole fencing group
must get initial values, and secondly, when a freshman arrives at a
group that has already Felo ratings.

@node Initial Felo ratings for the whole group
@subsection Initial Felo ratings for the whole group

Estimating the @emph{initial} Felo ratings for a fencing group is the
only tricky part when using Felo.  Fortunately, it has to be done only
once.  It is necessary because the Felo system can only calculate
@emph{changes} in the Felo rating, hence the initial value must come
from somewhere else.

So, the starting point are a bunch of fencing Felo-virgins.  Somebody
trustable of the group must estimate everybody with @emph{preliminary}
initial values.  This shouldn't be too critical since Felo will
recalculate all numbers anyway; more or less, it is only about
determining the mean fencing strength of the group.

I recommend to use the table in section @ref{Felo ratings} as a guide,
and to round all values to 100@tie{}points.  Thus, a possible result
could be:

@example
Alexander          1600
Julia              1400
Christian          1600
Mike               1300
Max                1500
George             1500
Peter              1700
Christine          1400
William            1700
@end example

The second important ingredient are bout result, the more the better,
although they should not be spread over a too long period of time.  Five
to ten bouts per fencer are a soft minimum, having taken place within
half a year.  It's not a big deal if you don't fulfil these
preconditions, though.  You enter the bout results and do the so-called
@emph{bootstrapping}.  Is means that the Felo program calculates the
best initial values from the preliminary ones provided by you.

For doing this, click on ``Calculate'' -- ``Bootstrapping'':

@image{felo-screen-2-de,5cm,,clicking on bootstrapping}

Then you click on ``Yes'' and wait for a couple of seconds (at most).
The new initial values are inserted into the file.  You should save the
file and you shouldn't touch the initial Felo ratings again, unless you
know what you're doing.  From now on, only bouts and new fencers are
added to the file.

If you haven't listed any bouts for far, you can use the preliminary
initial values, too, however, you must expect some wild behavious during
the first weeks, until the Felo ratings have found their true values.

On the other hand, if you already have a lot of bouts data, you should
use only the first part of it (e.@s{}g.@: the first six months) for the
bootstrapping.


@node Estimating freshmen
@subsection Estimating freshmen

A completely different task is adding freshmen (well, this includes all
fencers who come new into the group of course).  If the freshman already
has a current Felo rating, this is used for his or her initial value.
However, if he has not, it must be estimated.  Bootstrapping is
impossible since not all fencers must get a new initial value.

This works this way: The fencer is included into the fencer list as
``freshman'', which means that his initial value is set to a
symbolic@tie{}`@math{0}'.  After approx.@: ten 5@tie{}point@tie{}bouts
(or, e.@s{}g., four 15@tie{}point@tie{}bouts), the Felo program can
estimate an initial value.  Just click on the menu ``Calculate'' --
``Estimate freshmen'':

@image{felo-screen-3-de,5cm,,Estimate freshmen}

In this case, Obi Wan hasn't had a Felo rating yet.  After the
``Estimate freshmen'', his estimate is inserted into the
file.@footnote{This needn't be the same number which is calculated as
the @emph{current} Felo rating after calculating all bouts but it should
be very close to it.}  If the number of bouts of Obi@tie{}Wan is not yet
enough for estimating a reliable initial value, his initial value
remains@tie{}`@math{0}'.  In this case, he simply has to fence a little
bit more, and you must try again.

@unnumberedsubsec General parameters

@table @code

@item groupname
The name of the group that this Felo file belongs to.  A fencing club is
divided in the weapons, i.@s{}e.@: one group for each weapon and thus
one Felo file.  If appropriate, you may distinguish between women and
men as well, however, we didn't do this because we fence mixed anyway.

If you don't give a groupname, Felo constructs one from the filename.
For example, the file @file{foil.felo} gets the groupname ``Foil''.

@unnumberedsubsec Plot and HTML parameters

These parameters modify the appearance of the plot and the handling of
the HTML output, @xref{Putting the Felo ratings on the Web}.

@table @code

@item output folder
The folder to which the HTML files as well as the plot (if there is one)
are written.  Its default is the folder of the Felo file.

@item min distance of plot tics
The shotest distance in days between two training days in the plot that
get a text label.  This avoids two labels to overlap.  @emph{(Default:

@item earliest date in plot
The start day in the plot, i.@s{}e.@: from this day on training days are
included in the plot.  The format must be YYYY-MM-DD as usual.
@emph{(Default: 1980-01-01)}

@item maximal days in plot
The maximal number of day being included in the plot.  This prevents the

These parameters should only be used if you really know what you're
doing.

@table @code

@item k factor top fencers
The ka factor which is used for @emph{very} good fencers.
@emph{(Default: 25)}

@item felo rating top fencers
The minimal Felo rating of a top fencer.  If a fencer exceeds this limit
once, he or she is listed as a top fencer.  This only changes the
k@tie{}factor.  @emph{(Default: 2400)}

@item k factor others
The k factor used for ordinary fencers.  @emph{(Default: 32)}

@item k factor freshmen
The k factor used for (already estimated) freshmen.  Because their
number must find its true value yet, their k@tie{}factor usually is a
little bit higher than for ordinary fencers.  @emph{(Default: 40)}

@item 5 point bouts freshmen
The number of 5@tie{}point bouts that a freshman must have fenced in
order to become an ordinary -- or regular -- fencer.  This only changes
the k@tie{}factor.  This bout number is only a guiding value as the
exact number depends on the actual results.  Besides, 10 or
15@tie{}point bouts count more.  @emph{(Default: 15)}

@item minimal felo rating
The lowest possible Felo rating.  If a fencer would drop below this
limit, his rating is set exactly to this limit.  @emph{(Default: 1200)}

@item weighting team bout
Single bouts within a team match -- or other bouts -- are weighted like

@node The calculation
@section The calculation

The calculation of new Felo ratings is a three-steps process:

@enumerate
@item

Es wird der Resultatwert für den Fechter berechnet.  Das ist der Anteil
der Einzeltreffer, die er gesetzt hat.  Beispiel: Gewinnt der Fechter
15:10, ist der Resultatwert @math{15/(15+10)=0.6}.

@item
Dann wird aus der Differenz der Felo-Zahlen beider Fechter der
@emph{erwartete} Resultatwert berechnet.  Die Formel dazu findet man
z.@s{}B. im
@uref{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-Zahl#Berechnung,Wikipedia-Artikel zur
Elo-Zahl}.

@item
Die Differenz zwischen Resultat und erwartetem Resultat nenne ich mal
die @emph{Überraschung}.  Die Überraschung wird nun multipliziert mit
der Zahl der Einzeltreffer des Gefechts und zur alten Felo-Zahl
addiert.  Das ergibt die neue Felo-Zahl des Fechters.
@end enumerate

Um genau zu sein, wird die Überraschung auch mit dem sogenannten
@emph{k-Faktor} multipliziert, @xref{List of all parameters}.  Das hört
sich geheimnisvoller an, als es ist.  Der k-Faktor bestimmt, wie stark
sich die Felo-Zahlen ändern.  Ist er zu groß, wackeln die Felo-Zahlen zu
stark hin und her.  Ist er zu klein, dauert es zu lange, bis sich die
Felo-Zahl eines Fechter auf der wahren Spielstärke eingependelt hat.


@node Universal comparison of Felo ratings
@section Universal comparison of Felo ratings

Felo-Zahlen können nur Fechter innerhalb einer Fechtgruppe @emph{relativ}
vergleichen.  Damit man auch zwischen Gruppen vergleichen kann
(z.@s{}B. zwischen zwei Vereinen), muß man bei der 
Einschätzung der Anfangs-Felo-Zahlen (@pxref{Anfangs-Felo-Zahlen für die
ganze Gruppe}) sehr realistisch und sorgfältig vorgegangen sein.  Nun
gebe ich zu, daß Angaben wie ,,starke Freizeitspieler`` ziemlich
schwammig sind, deshalb ist das nur begrenzt realistisch.  Ein ganz
gutes Vergleichen sollte dennoch möglich sein.

Wesentlich besser ist es natürlich, wenn ein paar Fechter in beiden
Gruppen fechten.  Sie verbinden quasi die Felo-Zahlen beider Gruppen und
machen sie so vergleichbar.  Man kann dafür beide Gruppen zu einer
zusammenlegen.  Theoretisch reicht ein einzelner Fechter dafür aus, aber
der hat dann viel zu tun.  Wurde eine der beiden Fechtgruppen zu gut
bewertet, schaufelt er dann quasi die Punkte zur anderen Gruppe, bis
alles stimmig ist.

Man kann dazu natürlich auch die vielen Fechtturniere benutzen, ist aber
viel Arbeit: Man sammelt die Felo-Zahlen aller Fechter, gegen die die
eigenen Leute fechten @emph{und} die überhaupt eine Felo-Zahl haben,
ein.

Wie auch immer, es gibt leider noch zu wenig Erfahrung mit Felo-Zahlen,
um zu wissen, wie gut man Gruppen Felo-technisch durch gemeinsame
Fechter und/oder Turniere verbinden kann (so gut sie auch innerhalb
einer Gruppe funktionieren).

Übrigens lassen sich verschiedene Waffengattung nie richtig miteinander
verbinden, weil sie ja nie gegeneinander fechten können.  Da ist man
dann allein auf die realistische Einschätzung angewiesen.


@node Felo for other sports
@section Felo for other sports

Kann man das Felo-Programm auch in anderen Sportarten einsetzen?

Ja, man kann, allerdings funktionieren Teamsportarten nicht so gut.
Auch bei Sportarten, bei denen die Zeit ein Match beendet, funktioniert
es nicht so dolle.

Was Teamsportarten angeht, klappt Felo gar nicht, wenn man eine fixe
Gruppe aus @math{x}@tie{}Personen hat, aus denen an jedem Trainigstag
zwei beliebige Mannschaften zusammengestellt werden.  Wie soll man das
auch eintragen.  Nur, wenn man @math{x}@tie{}@emph{Teams} hat, die immer
aus den mehr oder weniger gleichen Leuten bestehen, kann man die Teams
als Sportler führen und ihre Ergebnisse aufschreiben.  Das schränkt die
Brauchbarkeit von Felo zugegebenermaßen deutlich ein, insbesondere im
Freizeitsport.

Bei Sportarten, die über die Zeit entschieden werden, kann man nur die
drei möglichen Ergebnisse 1:0, 0:1 und 1:1 benutzen, für Sieg,
Niederlage und unentschieden.  Allerdings fällt mir jetzt spontan keine
solche Sportart ein, die nicht auch eine Mannschaftssportart wäre.

Für alle anderen Sportarten mit einem Sportler-Sportler-Duell,
z.@s{}B. Tennis, Badminton, Tischtennis, Armdrücken, Wettblinzeln oder
Ostereiertitschen, gibt es an sich keine Schwierigkeiten.  Existiert
kein richtiger Endstand sondern nur Sieger und Verlierer (oder
unentschieden), dann siehe oben, ansonsten trägt man eben das Ergebnis
ein.

Es ist übrigens nicht so wichtig, ob man bei Sportarten mit Sätzen die
Sätze, Spiele oder Punkte als Grundlage nimmt.  Groß wird der
Unterschied nicht sein.  Beim Tennis kann man ein 6:4@tie{}6:3 entweder
als 2:0 oder als 12:7 eintragen.  (Man kann auch die Einzelpunkte
zählen, wenn man zuviel Zeit hat.)  Grundsätzlich gilt natürlich: Je
feiner, desto besser.


@node Felo for programmers
@section Felo for programmers

Dieser Abschnitt ist für Programmierer gedacht, die Felo in eigenen
Programmen benutzen wollen.

Eine grafische Bedienoberfläche ist nett, aber mit der kann man kaum
etwas automatisieren.  Beispielsweise ist es damit unmöglich, die
aktuellen Felo-Zahlen einer Fechtergruppe in eine bestehende Webseite
perfekt zu integrieren.  Insbesondere kann man mit dem
Standard-Felo-Programm nicht die Zahlen von Florett- und Degenfechtern
auf @emph{einer} Web-Seite unterbringen.

Für die meisten wird das kein Beinbruch sein, aber wer die totale
Kontrolle haben möchte, bekommt sie, und zwar gleich auf zwei
verschiedene Arten.

Zum einen kann man das Python-Modul @file{felo_rating.py} als
Kommandozeilen-Programm aufrufen.  Ich gebe hier mal nur den Hilfe-Text
dieses Programms an:

@example
Aufruf: felo_rating.py [Optionen]

Optionen:
  -h, --help            Zeige diese Meldung und beende das Programm
  -p, --plots           Erzeuge Plots der Felo-Zahlen
  -b, --bootstrap       Versuche, gute Start-Felo-Zahlen fuer alle zu
                        berechnen
  --max-cycles=NUMMER   Maximale Iterationsschritte beim Bootstrapping.
                        Default: 1000
  --estimate-freshmen   Versuche, Neueinsteiger zu bewerten
  --write-back          Schreibe die neuen Startzahlen zurueck in die Felo-
                        Datei
  --version             Zeige Versionsnummer und Lizenz-Informationen
  -o DATEINAME, --output=DATEINAME
                        Name der Ausgabedatei.  Default: Ausgabe auf dem
                        Bildschirm (stdout)
@end example

@noindent
Wer Felo als GUI-Programm einigermaßen verstanden hat, wird wissen, was
die einzelnen Optionen bedeuten.  Selbstverständlich ist das
Eingabeformat genau dasselbe Dateiformat wie in der GUI-Version.  Das
Ausgabeformat ist recht simpel und kann von einem eigenen Programm
eingelesen werden.

Zum anderen kann man auch direkt in Python ein eigenes Programm
schreiben und @file{felo_rating.py} als Modul einbinden.  Man kann dann
@uref{http://felo.sourceforge.net/api/,Felos API} nutzen, um eigene
Programme mit Felo-Zahlen zu schreiben.
