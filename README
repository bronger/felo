SUMMARY

Felo ratings are a wonderful new method to estimate fencers.  The Felo program
calculates these ratings for a given group of fencers.  The only thing the user
needs to do is to provide the program with a bout result list.  The program
offers a graphical user interface (using wxWidgets).


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

This section is intended for people who want to produce a distribution of the
Felo program.  It is not about installing it in general.

The RPM and Windows installer generation process is somewhat awkward because a)
distutils is buggy and b) I'm stupid.  In particular, I felt forced to split
the setup.py script in a Linux version (setup.py) and a Windows version
(setup_win32.py).  In the Linux version, I had to give the path to the language
translations (the .mo files) as an absolute path in my file system because
otherwise, the bdist_rpm command doesn't find them.  So if you want to build an
RPM and your home directory is not /home/bronger, you must change it manually.

The other stupid thing is the generation of the .mo files.  The bast way to
achive this is to delete all .gmo files in the po/ directory and to call
"make".  AT the same time, this updates the .po files from the .py sources.

General checklist:

* If new translations arrived, update po/Makefile and both setup scripts.
  Remember to have also the licence and the boilerplate in this language (not
  necessary, but nice).  Ideally, the documentation, too.  :-)

* If new strings to-be-translated have been insterted into the Python source
  codes, remove all .gmo files in po/ and call make there in order to update
  the .po files.

* Remove all .gmo files in po/ and call make there (again).

* If a new version number is to be released, update the version number in this
  file, the source code (global variable "distribution_version" in felo.py and
  felo_rating.py), and both setup scripts.

For Linux RPM generation:

* python setup.py sdist
  python setup.py bdist_rpm

For Windows py2exe generation:

* c:\python24\python setup_win32.py py2exe

* in Windows explorer, right-click on nsis\felo.nsi and say "compile NSIS
  script".

* The installer is then written to nsis\.
